-- Serialization in the bakend converts complex, in-memory objects (like user data, lists) into a portable format(like JSON, XML, or bytes) for storage or network transfer.
Deserialization does the reverse, turning that stream back into usable objects, bridging communication gaps between different systems and enabling persistece, caching and distributed processing. 

Backend services uses these processes to send data to frontend, save to databases, or communicatie with other microservices. 

 ---> Serialization

What it is: The process of converting an object's state (data and structure) into a format suitable for storage or transmission, such as a sequence of bytes or a text-based format like JSON.

---> Why it's needed:

-Network Communication: Different systems (e.g., browser and server, microservices) speak different languages; data needs a universal format like JSON/XML to travel over HTTP.
-Persistence: To save an object's state to a file, database, or cache, it must be serialized.
-Caching: Storing serialized objects for faster retrieval later.
-Common Formats: JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), binary formats (like Java's native serialization). 


---> Deserialization
What it is: The reverse process; converting the serialized data (bytes, JSON string) back into a live, usable object in the application's memory.
Why it's needed: To process incoming network requests or data retrieved from storage as meaningful objects (e.g., a user object with properties like name and age).
